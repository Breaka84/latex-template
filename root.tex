\begin{abstract}
Using virtual worlds or Augmented Reality for Business Process Modeling (BPM) is a fairly new approach 
in the process modeling field. Having domain experts with little modeling skills and process modeling
experts with no knowledge of the process to be modeled requires new solutions. This paper examines three
different methods to give an overview of current approaches, which try to overcome this problem by
tangible physical objects, virtual reality, and Augmented Reality respectively. The analysis is done
on the basis of secondary research only. Physical and tactile modeling makes it easy for domain experts 
to interact with the model. The major drawback of the necessary manual transcription of the results is 
being avoided by the idea to include the modeler into virtual worlds. Using the Second Life engine provides
easier immersion into the model than general BPM methods. This solution lacks the natural communication
component such as nonverbal signals, which is overcome by combining the two aforementioned solutions. 
An augmented tabletop featuring physical objects and direct software integration requires in turn special
hardware. There is no perfect method at this time but current methods already provide significant advantages
over traditional BPM procedures.\\
